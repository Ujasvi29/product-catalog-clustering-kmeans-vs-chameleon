Project Description

This project presents a comparative study of clustering techniques applied to high-dimensional product catalog data. It analyzes and compares a traditional distance-based algorithm (K-Means) with a graph-based clustering approach inspired by Chameleon, implemented using HDBSCAN.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering from numerical, categorical, and textual attributes, dimensionality reduction using PCA, and clustering evaluation using silhouette scores and visualizations such as scatter plots and heatmaps. The study highlights how different clustering methods perform on complex, real-world e-commerce data and demonstrates the advantages of graph-based clustering for irregular and non-spherical cluster structures.

The project showcases practical applications of unsupervised learning in product categorization, recommendation systems, and large-scale catalog organization.

•	The silhouette score of 0.3178 for K-Means indicates moderate cluster quality.
•	The silhouette score of 0.6665 for HDBSCAN shows that clusters are well-defined, cohesive, and well-separated.
•	This confirms that the Chameleon-like method performs significantly better on this dataset.
