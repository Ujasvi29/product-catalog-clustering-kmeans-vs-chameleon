Steps to Run the Code
Step 1: Open the Environment
Open Google Colab (recommended)
OR
Open Jupyter Notebook (with Python installed)

Step 2: Install Required Libraries (only once)
Run this cell before the code:
!pip install hdbscan
(Other libraries like numpy, pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib are usually preinstalled.)

Step 3: Upload the Dataset
Run the code cell
When prompted with “Please upload your CSV”, upload:
a CSV file, or
a ZIP file containing a CSV
The program automatically:
Detects ZIP or CSV
Extracts and loads the dataset

Step 4: Data Preprocessing
The code automatically:
Selects important columns
Removes missing values
Converts numerical, categorical, and text features into numeric vectors

Step 5: Feature Engineering & Dimensionality Reduction
Numerical features are scaled
Text is converted using TF-IDF
Features are reduced using PCA for efficient clustering

Step 6: Apply Clustering Algorithms
K-Means clustering is applied with fixed clusters
Chameleon-like clustering is implemented using HDBSCAN

Step 7: Evaluate Clustering Performance
Silhouette score is calculated for both methods
Higher score indicates better clustering quality

Step 8: Visualize Results
The program generates:
Cluster heatmap
PCA-based scatter plots for both clustering methods

Step 9: View Final Output

Silhouette scores are displayed

Final conclusion shows which clustering method performed better
